# cookiecutter-fastapi

This is a template that can help you quickly develop the fastAPI backend. You only need a few easy steps to build a basic framework.

## What is Cookiecutter?

Cookiecutter is a CLI tool (Command Line Interface) to create an application boilerplate from a template. It uses a templating system — Jinja2 — to replace or customize folder and file names, as well as file content.

## What's Included in the Template?

This is a project based entirely on `poetry` for package management, and the system mainly includes the following tools: **Poetry**, **FastAPI**, **MyPY**, **PyTest**, **Ruff**, **Docker**, **Docker-Compose**

>We expect to integrate `MySQL` into templates in the future for better development.

## Quick Start

The template includes an interface for news information extraction tasks based on LLM. You can refer to the README for environment configuration and quickly use it.

**Install Cookiecutter First**

```sh
pip install cookiecutter
```

**Generate a FastAPI Project**

```sh
cookiecutter XXX
```
